# image-class
The dataset consists of 60000 32 × 32 color (RBG) images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. The dataset is divided into five training batches and one test batch, each with 10000 images. First I wrote the functions to load the training and testing images with their corresponding labels, then save them as RDS files. Then another function to view the image with its label. After displaying it graphically, I decided which pixels at which color channels seem the most likely to be useful for classification. Then I use k-nearest neighbors algorithm to predict the label for a point or collection of points, and then use 10-fold cross-validation to estimate the error rate for k-nearest neighbors  in percentage for each fold. I do that by shuffling the training dataset randomly by row so it can randomly divide the data set into 10 equally sized fold with new training and testing data for each fold. After I display graphically 10-fold CV error rates using Euclidean and maximum methods as distance metric, I realized that the best combination of k and distance metric is k = 2 and when using “Euclidean” as the distance metric. After that, I use 10-fold cross-validation to estimate the confusion matrix to conclude that k = 2 , 3 , 8 has the least error rate by using “Euclidean” And k = 6, 13, 12 has the least error rate using “maximum” method. 

#Note:
All the files (rds files and bin batches) that contains the datasets are too large so they cant be uploaded.
